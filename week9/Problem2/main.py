# Create a solution for a shop that wants to keep track of the stock of their products and wants to give a discount to customers who buy large quantities of the product.
#
# Write a class called Product
#
# Criteria:
# The class should have attributes called name, amount, and price (holding the productâ€™s name, the number of items of that product in stock, and the regular price of the product).
# There should be a method get_price that receives the number of items to be bought and returns the total costs.
# There should also be a method called make_purchase that receives the number of items to be bought and decreases amount by that much.
# Extra:
# Regular price if orders have less than 10 item;
# 10% discount is applied for orders of between 10 and 99 items;
# 20% discount is applied for orders of 100 items or more.
# Input example:
# No input is given
#
# Output example:
# No output is required
