# {Optional problem}
#
# Spelling mistakes are only one of many different kinds of errors that might appear in a written work.
# Another error that is common for some writers is a repeated word.
# For example, an author might inadvertently duplicate a word,
# as shown in the following sentence:
#
# At least one value must be entered entered in order to compute the average.
# Some word processors will detect this error and identify it when a spelling or grammar check is performed.
# In this exercise you will write a program that detects repeated words in a text file.
# When a repeated word is found your program should display a message that contains the line number and the repeated word.
#
# Example:
# Found duplicate word [something] on line: 10
# Then the program must ask the user if the repeated word has to be removed or if it should find and display the next instance of a duplicate word. The name of the examined file will be provided as the programâ€™s only command line parameter. Display an appropriate error message if the user fails to provide a command line parameter, or if an error occurs while processing the file.
