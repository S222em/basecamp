# In this exercise, you will create a program that removes all of the comments from a Python source file.
#
# Extra:
# Python uses the # character to mark the beginning of a comment.
# The comment ends at the end of the line containing the # character.
# Check each line in the file to determine if a # character is present. If it is then your program should remove all of the characters from the # character to the end of the line (weâ€™ll ignore the situation where the comment character occurs inside of a string).
# The user will also enter the name of the input file.
# Save the modified file using a new name that will be entered by the user.
# Input example (correct):
# File to read: functiontest.txt
# File to save: cleaned-functiontest.txt
#
# Output example (correct):
# No output should be given
#
# Input example (error):
# blanc
#
# Output example (error):
# Error reading file: "blanc"
