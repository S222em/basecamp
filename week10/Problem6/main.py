# When you write a function, it is a good idea to include a comment that outlines the functionâ€™s purpose, its parameters and its return value. However, sometimes comments are forgotten, or left out by well-intentioned programmers that plan to write them later but then never get around to it.
#
#
# Create a python program that reads one or more Python source files and identifies functions that are not immediately preceded by a comment.
#
# Extra:
# For the purposes of this exercise, assume that any line that begins with def, followed by a space, is the beginning of a function definition.
# Assume that the comment character, #, will be the first character on the previous line when the function has a comment.
# Display the names of all of the functions that do not have a comment, along with the file name and line number where the function definition is located.
# The user will provide the names of one or more Python files as command line parameters (comma separated).
# Input example (correct):
# functiontest.txt
#
# Output example (correct):
# File: functiontest.txt contains a function [function_name_here()] on line [1] without a preceding comment.
# File: functiontest.txt contains a function [another_function_name_here()] on line [15] without a preceding comment.
# Input example (error):
# functiontest.txt, blanc
#
# Output example (error):
# File: functiontest.txt contains a function [function_name_here()] on line [1] without a preceding comment.
# File: functiontest.txt contains a function [another_function_name_here()] on line [15] without a preceding comment.
# Error reading file: "blanc"
