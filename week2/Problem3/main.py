# Write a program that determines the name of a shape from its number of sides.
# Read the number of sides from the user and then report the appropriate name as part of a meaningful message.
#
# Criteria:
# Your program should support shapes with anywhere from 3 up to (and including) 10 sides.
# If a number of sides outside of this range is entered then your program should display the error message: Amount of sides is out of range.
# Input examples:
# Sides: 3
# Sides: 4
# Output examples:
# Triangle
# Square
