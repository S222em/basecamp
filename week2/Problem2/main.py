# Most years have 365 days. However, the time required for the Earth to orbit the Sun is actually slightly more than that.
# As a result, an extra day, February 29, is included in some years to correct for this difference.
# Such years are referred to as leap years.
# Write a program that reads a year from the user and displays a message indicating whether it is a leap year.
#
# Criteria:
# Any year that is divisible by 400 is a leap year.
# Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 100 is not a leap year.
# Of the remaining years, any year that is divisible by 4 is a leap year.
# All other years are not leap years.
# Input examples:
# Year: 2012
# Year: 2011
# Output examples:
# Leap year
# Not a leap year

year = input("Year: ")

if not year.isdigit():
    print("Please enter a valid integer")
    exit()

year = int(year)
is_leap_year = year % 400 == 0 or (year % 100 != 0 and year % 4 == 0)
