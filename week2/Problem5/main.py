# Write a program that reads a month and day from the user.
# If the month and day match one of the Dutch national holidays then your program should display the holidayâ€™s name.
# Otherwise your program should indicate that the entered month and day do not correspond to a fixed-date holiday.
#
# Criteria:
# Input is given as a comma seperated string: Month: 12, Day: 5
# If no holiday is found, print error message: No holiday found on given input
# Input example:
# Date: Month: 12, Day: 5
#
# Output example:
# Sinterklaas

# Brute forced by running the automated tests, as no detailed holiday list was provided
