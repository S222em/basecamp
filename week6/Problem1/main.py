# Implement a program that determines and displays the number of unique characters in a string entered by the user.
# For example, Hello, World! has 10 unique characters while zzz has only 1 unique character.
#
# Criteria:
# Use only dictionaries to solve this problem (create a function: unique_chars_dict).
# Use only sets to solve this problem (create a function: unique_chars_set).
# Make sure to implement both functions!
# Input example:
# Hello, World!
#
# Output example:
# Unique characters: 10

# Useless but ok.
