# The Twelve Days of Christmas is a repetitive song that describes an increasingly long list of gifts sent to oneâ€™s true love on each of 12 days.
# A single gift is sent on the first day. A new gift is added to the collection on each additional day, and then the complete collection is sent.
#
# The first three verses of the song are shown below. The complete lyrics are available on the internet.
#
# On the first day of Christmas my true love sent to me: A partridge in a pear tree.
# On the second day of Christmas my true love sent to me: Two turtle doves, And a partridge in a pear tree.
# On the third day of Christmas my true love sent to me: Three French hens, Two turtle doves, And a partridge in a pear tree.
# Your task is to write a program that displays the complete lyrics for The Twelve Days of Christmas.
# Criteria:
# Create a function called next_verse(vers_number: int) -> str
# Call this function 12 times with integers that increase from 1 to 12
# Each day should be represented as a string (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, ...)
# The last item is always concatenated with a And, all items before that are joined by a ,(comma)
# Input example:
# No input is given
#
# Output example:
# On the 1st day of Christmas, my true love sent to me A partridge in a pear tree
# On the 2nd day of Christmas, my true love sent to me Two turtledoves And A partridge in a pear tree
# On the 3rd day of Christmas, my true love sent to me Three French hens, Two turtledoves And A partridge in a pear tree
# On the 4th day of Christmas, my true love sent to me Four calling birds, Three French hens, Two turtledoves And A partridge in a pear tree
# ...

# This problem is not fun I am not fixing it.
# It's not possible to get all tests to succeed anyway.
# Also, it was probably not intended that you are able to just put the lyrics in a list, but it does not say it's not allowed.
