# Usually companies use predefined templates for their emails.
# A company named XYZ would like to have a Python program that collects basic information and generates an email from a template.
#
# Criteria:
# There are only two templates: Job Offer and Rejection.
# For the Job Offer email, the program asks: first name, last name, job title, annual salary, starting date.
# For the Rejection email, the program asks: first name, last name, job title, with or without feedback, one feedback statement in case it is with feedback.
# First and last names: each minimum two characters and maximum ten characters; cotaining only alphabets, both starting with capital letters.
# The program must check valid input formats: define a function is_name_valid(first_name:str,last_name:str)->bool. The function is_name_valid gets two parameters of type string and returns the result of type boolean.
# Job title: minimum 10 characters without numbers.
# The program must check valid input formats: define a function is_title_valid(title:str)->bool. The function is_title_valid receives one parameter of type string and returns the result of type boolean.
# Salary: valid floating point number between (and including) 20.000,00 and 80.000,00.
# The program must check valid input formats: define a function is_salary_valid(salary:str)->bool. The function is_salary_valid receives one parameter of type string and returns the result of type boolean.
# Date: only in YYYY-MM-DD format, no negative numbers, days between 1 - 31, month between 1 - 12, year only 2021 and 2022.
# The program must check valid input formats: define a function is_date_valid(date:str)->bool. The function is_date_valid receives one parameter of type string and returns the result of type boolean.
# Feedback: if the email contains a feedback there is an extra line in the text otherwise that line must be removed (check the example below).
# The program will generate emails until the user answers No to the More Letters? question.
# In case of invalid input from the user, the program must print the message Input error and then repeat the question.
# Sample execution
# Use this sample execution for the templates of the emails.
#
# Input example (Job Offer):
# More Letters? (Yes or No) Yes
# Job Offer or Rejection? Job Offer
# First Name? John
# Last Name? Hartman
# Job Title? Junior Python Programmer
