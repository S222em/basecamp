# A string is a palindrome if it is identical forward and backward.
# For example “anna”, “civic”, “level” and “hannah” are all examples of palindromic words.
# Write a program that reads a string from the user and uses a loop to determines whether it is a palindrome.
# Display the result, including a meaningful output message.
#
# Extra (additional challenge):
# Extend your solution so that is also ignores punctuation marks (like , . ? ! ;)
# Extend your solution so that it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent.
# Input example:
# String: anna
# String: hannah
# String: lepels
# Output example:
# "anna" is a palindrome
# "hannah" is a palindrome
# "lepels" is not a palindrome
